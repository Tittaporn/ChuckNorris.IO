# ChuckNorris.IO
This project is an iOS application showing the jokes from fetching data on Chucknorris.IO which is a free JSON API for hand curated Chuck Norris facts. Chuck Norris facts are satirical factoids about martial artist and actor Chuck Norris that have become an Internet phenomenon and as a result have become widespread in popular culture. The 'facts' are normally absurd hyperbolic claims about Norris' toughness, attitude, virility, sophistication, and masculinity.

## Afternoon project Week4 Day3 : Networking
Each student should build their own app using any free API. Your app must parse at least two levels down into JSON. Your URLRequest should not require headers. But you can choose to google work with any API.

One thing to avoid is API's that involve Authorization (OAuth1.0, OAuth2.0, Bearer Tokens, Basic Auth, Digest Auth)

You can attempt to use an API that requires sending an API Key, as API Keys are extremely common and provide you with valuable practice.
